      <description>r { color: Red } bl { color: Blue } g { color: Green }  As a final-year student who has some experience about artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning (ML), it&amp;rsquo;s great for me to have a chance to revisit the definition of AI through the introductory course to AI at Stanford University - CS221 - which content is available online. This is also a chance for me to look back at the Introduction to AI course that I studied in my second year at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST).</description>

      <description>Hi. This is the first course review I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done on my blog, and today I will review the 2 series of courses on the same topic: Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps for short.
What to expect in this review:
 An overview of what these programs do and don&amp;rsquo;t provide The topics that are focused in each series and technological stacks used Methods of teaching, reviewing, and testing My experience studying each of these programs: what I find interesting (and what need to be improved)  What NOT to expect in my review:</description>

      <description>Hi again. This is Dung Dao Minh, vice president of SoICT Innovation Club, and in this third post of series &amp;ldquo;Github 101&amp;rdquo;, I will talk about some kind of scenarios that can happen when you work on multiple branches in your work repositories, or work in collaboration with a team on a project.
First words In many cases, you (and your collaborators) create multiple branches for different purpose: creating features, bug fixing, code versioning,&amp;hellip; Most of the issues happen when you try to combine the code between those branches: you may realize that you still commit to the main branch while fixing bugs/adding features, another developer may add a little documentation on your code (which is great), or your evil coworker might mess up with your code and make it full of bugs.</description>
